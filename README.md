# swr-vs-rquery

This purpose of this repository is to show the comparison between swr and react-query. Even though this is not a fair comparison, the use case of the examples here is to just fetch random data from the api and re-fetch it when you click the button.

In this example, only some of the features of react-query are used, but in swr, this is its sole purpose (to revalidate when stale).
